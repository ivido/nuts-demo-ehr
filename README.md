# Nuts demo EHR system

This application is pretending to be an electronic health record system. You can
use it to demo how healthcare professionals can work together by sharing
information with colleagues through the Nuts nodes.

This version is an updated version using vue.js as frontend framework and a Golang backend. It's based on the [nuts-registry-admin-demo](https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-registry-admin-demo).

Go to the [master](https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-registry-admin-demo/tree/master/) branch to find the previous version of the app.

**NOTE THAT THIS APPLICATION IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE WITH REAL MEDICAL
INFORMATION! IT IS IN NO WAY DEVELOPED TO BE SAFE, STABLE OR EVEN USABLE FOR
SUCH PURPOSE.**
